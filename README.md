# Mastering ActiveRecord
This Rails app will teach you ActiveRecord querying through test driven development. Gone are the days of calling Ruby array methods and Enumerables on ActiveRecord Associations. Knowing these query methods will make your Rails app faster as you reduce the amount of times it has to travel to the database.
## Getting Started
- clone down the repo `git clone https://github.com/bryceholcomb/mastering_activerecord.git`
- change into the new directory `cd mastering_activerecord`
- run `bundle install`
- run `rake db:setup`
- open your favorite text editor and navigate to the `/test/` directory
- begin by learning the ActiveRecord::QueryMethods themselves through TDD
- then graduate on to learning how to use them within a Rails app
